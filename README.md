# SentinelDAO

SentinelDAO is a **decentralized AI security auditor** that evaluates **smart contracts, blockchain protocols, and DeFi projects** for vulnerabilities and inefficiencies. The platform integrates **AI-driven risk assessment, governance-powered security decisions, and bounty incentives** for community engagement.

## Project Features

- **AI-Powered Smart Contract Audits** – Uses AI models trained on historical exploit data to detect potential vulnerabilities.
- **Decentralized Governance** – Token-holders vote on audit priorities, risk factors, and platform updates.
- **Bug Bounty System** – Ethical hackers and developers earn rewards for identifying vulnerabilities through an incentivized program.
- **Real-Time Risk Analytics** – Interactive dashboard displaying live security assessments, contract risk levels, and threat alerts.
- **Automated Threat Intelligence** – AI continuously monitors and scans DeFi protocols for new attack vectors and anomaly detection.
- **On-Chain Verification** – Security reports and audit results are stored on-chain for full transparency and immutability.
- **Multi-Chain Support** – Expanding coverage to Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible networks.
- **API Access for Developers** – Provides API endpoints for integrating security insights into external applications.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React (Next.js) for server-side rendering and improved performance.
- TailwindCSS for efficient and responsive UI design.

### Backend:
- Node.js (Express) for handling API requests and database interactions.
- GraphQL for efficient and flexible data fetching.
- PostgreSQL for structured audit data storage and indexing.

### Smart Contracts:
- Solidity (Hardhat) for smart contract deployment and testing.
- OpenZeppelin security standards for contract safety.
- Chainlink oracles for reliable external data feeds.

### AI & Data Analysis:
- Python (TensorFlow / Scikit-learn) for machine learning-driven risk analysis.
- Custom NLP models for detecting fraudulent contract patterns.

### Blockchain Integration:
- Ethereum (Ethers.js) for interacting with smart contracts.
- IPFS for decentralized and permanent storage of audit reports.
- TheGraph for indexing blockchain data efficiently.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Yarn or npm**
- **Hardhat**
- **Docker** (for running services like PostgreSQL locally)

### Steps to Install & Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sentineldao/sentineldao.git
   cd sentineldao
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   yarn install  # or npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the necessary keys.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   yarn dev  # or npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run the blockchain and database services (if needed)**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Compile and deploy smart contracts**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

Your local SentinelDAO instance should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
